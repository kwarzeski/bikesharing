### Additional Visualizations:
- Tripduration across locations - where are the longer trips ocurring? 
- Comparison of subsriber vs customer locations. Service should be promoted ahead of launch in areas with anticipated subscriber usage. Promotions for one-time customers should be ready in frequent usage areas (Are subsribers usually further out of the city or further in the city? Are one-time customers clustered in downtown only?)
